const introduction = `
I’m Sabin Paudel, a frontend developer based in Pokhara, Nepal. I specialize in
building modern web applications with React, Next.js, and TypeScript — from
marketing sites and community platforms to full e-commerce systems.

My work focuses on interfaces that are fast, responsive, and accessible. I care
about clear information hierarchy, sensible performance budgets, and code that
stays easy to maintain as a product grows.

I’m currently working as a frontend developer in Pokhara, contributing to
production React and Next.js applications, and I enjoy turning complex product
ideas into interfaces that are simple to use and simple to extend.
